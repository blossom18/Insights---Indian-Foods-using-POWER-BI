The Indian Cuisine is as varied it can be where due to the various food culture of different parts of the country as well as the fact that India is home to quite a few religions and castes there are a plethora of India dishes. Quite a good number of ingredients are used in these dishes depending upon the food tastes of the local people and their culture. Also Indian dishes take a good amount of time to cook and prepare and there are a few instances where foods similar in taste and ingredients are called by different names.
